IMPORTANT:

As of the most recent commit, only the Gryffindor path is fully operational, while the other three paths will be completed
as part of the second build. The sorting hat quiz will still sort you into the respective house, but in order to activate
the Gryffindor path, the sequence during the quiz will be 3, 1, 4, 2, 3.

For demonstration of the final build, this path will not be used but rather an alternate path that will enable the user to
skip the story, allowing for a quicker demonstration that showcases only the essentials of the project.

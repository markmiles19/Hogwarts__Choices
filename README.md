IMPORTANT:

As of the most recent commit, only the Gryffindor path is fully operational, while the other three paths will be completed
as part of the second build. The sorting hat quiz will still sort you into the respective house, but in order to activate
the Gryffindor path, the sequence during the quiz will be 3, 1, 4, 2, 3.
